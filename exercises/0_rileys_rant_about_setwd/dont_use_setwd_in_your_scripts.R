# in your console, run this without the hashtag:
# getwd()

# in your console, set your working directory to this folder
# it probably lives somewhere along the lines of 
# ~/Documents/dev/gwu-harlan-r
# in your console, that would look like 
# setwd("~/Documents/dev/gwu-harlan-r")

# we do this because we have to tell R where to look for files
# we do this in the **console** (not in our scripts) so that our work stays reproducible
