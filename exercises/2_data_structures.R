# why does this fail?
x = 1
y = "2"
#z = x + y

# class()
# str()
# convert between types using as.whatever()

# various numeric types play nice together automatically
foo = 4.9
bar = as.integer(3)
# baz = foo + bar

# [] vs [[]] vs $

# how do factors work under the hood?
# why prefer factor over string?

# vectors, lists
