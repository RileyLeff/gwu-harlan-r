# Challenge: Scalars-as-vectors and missing values
#
# 1. Create an object s that holds the single value 8.
#    • What is length(s)?
#    • What happens if you ask for s[3]?
#
# 2. Build a numeric vector v <- 1:10. Replace the 4th and 9th
#    elements with NA, then compute the sum of v ignoring missing values.
#
# 3. Create an empty object e <- NULL. Verify that length(e) == 0,
#    then try c(e, 5). What class is the result?
#
# 4. Create an ordered factor called temp with values  "low","med","high","med".
#    Confirm that temp[3]  >  temp[1]  is TRUE.
#
# Write your code below, save, and run source("challenge.R") to test.
