1. what's the point?
    - why learn to program
    - something encouraging idk

2. big-picture info
    - what is a:
        -   programming language
                - R != R Interpreter != RStudio
        -   interpreter
                - interactive session
                - run script
        -   directory/filesystem
                - working directory
                - relative vs absolute paths
                - no spaces in file names you heathens
        -   IDE/text editor

        -   package/library
            

    - why use R
        -   [insert R backstory?]
        -   strengths
        -   weaknesses

3.  R Data Structures
        - atomics
            -   logical
            -   int
            -   double (numeric)
            -   complex
            -   character
            -   raw
        - lists
        - matrix
            - stuck with single datatype
        - dataframe
            - just a list of lists w same number of rows!
        - factors
        - expressions
            - worth mentioning so people don't fall into the lm(x~y) trap
        - functions
        - NULL
            - NULL vs NA
        - environments
            - just talk about global vs function scope 
        - attrs
            - names, metadata, etc


        [no need for details, but see also:]
        - language objects
        - ...
        - promises

4.  Functions
    - structure
    - examples
    - from package
        - NAMESPACE COLLISIONS
    - user-defined
    - HOW TO READ DOCUMENTATION

5. control flow
    - if
    - else
    - for
    - while

6. plotting
    - base
        - xy
        - hist
    - ggplot
